# Itinerary App

This project was a part of Microsoft's FHL for E+D. This is a travel itinerary app that creates an itinerary for the place and number of days you specify.

It uses OpenAI's API calls. I would like to thank team OpenAI for the same.

# Motivation

The motivation for this was ofcourse ChatGPT!!

The idea revolves around automating tedious tasks such as preparing an Itinerary.
